## Learnings and Issues
Some of the learnings I'm taking away from this project are:
1. An issue I ran into with this project was deployment. The application worked great for me on my local environment. My seeded data appeared in the application and everything worked pretty smoothly. However, upon deploying to Heroku, I ran into issues. There was no seeded data. And, even when you input new data, it didn't seem to be saving to the database. 

## Future Application Updates
* Add total duration data points.
